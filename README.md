# SERVICIO TÃ‰CNICO CARD FROM A LOCAL BUSINESS

Today, I was away from my laptop pretty much all day. However, I have a personal target of finishing a project each day in CSS until I become proficient enough in it. As I was leaving my house, I checked the mailbox and came across a card for a business that was advertising their plumbing services. I thought the card looked like a good challenge to try and recreate using CSS, and since I have Koder (a mobile code editor) installed on my phone, I thought I'd give it a go and try to complete this challenge entirely on my phone. (I don't have internet on my phone atm since I'm in a different country and I have no international roaming left.) This was perfect because it meant I couldn't seek help online, so I had to rely completely on the files I had on my phone and the literal card as a reference.

This is by no means clean formatted code, but I really wanted to keep my 2-day streak going, so it is what it is. I could've cleaned it up once I got home, but I'll leave it like this so I can compare it with future challenges like this that I decide to take on.

If you know enough, you really only need a text editor, so this is motivation for future me!

## CHALLENGES I Faced:

With this one, the first thing I had a hard time getting around until I just used common sense was the pictures on the card. At first, I tried to recreate some really bad CSS shapes for the brand logos and the flame and boiler until I realized I can still use the crop features in the iPhone's photo editor. I was also able to just hold down on the cropped photo of what I wanted, and the iPhone automatically created a sticker from the element I cropped. Through the share button, I was able to export that as a .png into a new folder I made called `img`.

With that out of the way, the next thing I found difficult but managed to overcome was writing the code. I haven't got much experience with Koder, and Emmet on VSCode just makes life way too easy. So just creating a `div`, for example, or a simple `ul` with `li`'s in it was a pain. After a while, I realized that you can create your own shortcut keys with code within them, so I wrote out some common code and attached it to shortcut keys to make my life a bit easier.

Finally, the last thing that was a bit challenging was getting the layout as close as possible. Since there's no devtools that I'm aware of on mobile, I had to just keep guessing at `rem` units and grid and flex layouts until I got close enough. This, however, has highlighted the areas in which I need to improve and the concepts I thought I knew pretty well, which evidently I was wrong on, and I will devote more time to those things to truly be comfortable with them. One such case was "how do I align the grid items in their own cells?" This trivial question took me longer than I am prepared to admit, but after a long bit, I finally got it. (It was `align-self` and `justify-self`, Lol)

The last thing that I didn't get for a long time was declaring a `@font-face` for the Kanit-Black font that I used. It just wouldn't work for almost an hour until I realized that autocorrect was spelling Kanit wrong every time I entered it, and in the `src`, I had it misspelled.

This was definitely a great challenge, especially for a beginner like myself, since it forced me to rely on what I actually have learned and had to type out pretty much everything. It also highlighted the areas in which I was wrong to declare them as 'proficient' in my own mind, such as the aforementioned challenges.

# OFFLINE APPS THAT HELPED ME:

The first one being 'Koder' as you're going to need a code editor that enables you to see your CSS as you're writing it.

The second one is an app called 'COLOR PICKER' (free on the App store) that gives you hex codes for colors. It has a myriad of ways in which it can extract colors or help you pick them, but I only used the "Pick from photo" option, and that worked wonderfully.

I guess that's all for this challenge. Thanks for reading!

I left all the files and everything I used in the repo so feel free to make a better version of this. Or if not just pick up any random card and try to recreate it with CSS, and be strict with yourself - This is by far the most eye-opening challenge I've set myself, and I'm happy I got as close to the design as I did.

It took me around 4 hours this time around, but I'm sure the next time I'll be a lot faster!

Any advice that you may have on how I could've done things more efficiently is extremely welcome! Taha A.
